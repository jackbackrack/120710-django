<h1>Mission</h1>
Quite simply, 120710 is a catalyst for art. We believe that a gallery is the fulcrum between the artists and the community. Our mission is to nurture artists, foster the love of art, and build community around art. We feel that the fastest way for artistic growth is through experimentation and iteration. We provide an artistic platform and a creative safe-house to try new ideas and celebrate art. We are a no-profit with 100% of the art sales going to the artists because we want to ensure curatorial integrity. We don’t make money from art sales; we make artists from art sales. 120710 is an experimental gallery showing experimental work and we are always exploring ways to modernize and improve the art-going experience. We are striving to show the best possible art to better inspire and push artists to do their best and make hearts beat the fastest. We do group shows to maximize the number of artists showing and the growth of our community. Furthermore, every show has a new set of curators to ensure diversity. We choose curators, not artists. If you have a strong curatorial idea aligned with our philosophy, send a proposal to <a href="mailto:info@120710.art">info@120710.art</a>.  We are ambitious. We believe in the power of a gallery, in artists and the Bay Area, and more generally the potential for catalyzing art.
