# 120710

Open-source Django gallery management application for [120710.art](https://www.120710.art), an experimental art gallery at 1207 Tenth Street, Berkeley, CA.

Manages artists, artworks, exhibitions (shows), events, and juror reviews/ratings with public-facing pages, a role-based admin workflow, Mailchimp mailing list integration, and Schema.org JSON-LD structured data on every content page.

---

## Features

- **Artists** — profile pages with bio, statement, image, website, Instagram, and linked artworks
- **Artworks** — detail pages with medium, dimensions, pricing, Schema.org `VisualArtwork` structured data
- **Shows (Exhibitions)** — M2M artists and curators, artworks inline, open-call support, Schema.org `VisualArtsEvent`
- **Events** — linked to shows with date/time, Schema.org `VisualArtsEvent` with `superEvent`
- **Reviews and ratings** — per-show juror assignments with one 1..5 rating/review per juror-artwork-show
- **Tags** — filterable across all content types; special `Open Call` tag for open-call submissions
- **Role-based access** — `artist`, `curator`, `juror`, `staff` groups with granular permissions
- **Google OAuth** via django-allauth
- **Admin** — ShowAdmin with artwork inline and filter_horizontal for artists/curators/tags; CSV/Excel import-export on all models
- **Schema.org JSON-LD** — Pydantic-validated structured data on every public detail page
- **Mailchimp sync** — mailing list management via Mailchimp API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- A `.env.local` file (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below)

### Start the stack

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.local up
```

This starts:
- `db` — PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB) on port 5432
- `web` — Django dev server on port 8000
- `pgadmin` — pgAdmin on port 5050

### Apply migrations

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.local exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a superuser

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.local exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Run tests

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.local exec web python manage.py test gallery
```

## Data Model

```
Tag <──M2M── Artist, Artwork, Show, Event

Artist ──M2M──> Show.artists        (artist.shows)
Artist ──M2M──> Show.curators
Artist <──M2M── Artwork.artists     (artist.artworks)

Show <──FK── Event.show             (show.events, CASCADE)
Show <──M2M── Artwork.shows         (show.artworks)

User ──FK──> Artist.user            (user.artists)
User ──FK──> Show.managing_curator  (user.managed_shows)
User ──FK──> Artwork.created_by

Show <──FK── ShowJuror.show         (show.jurors)
User <──FK── ShowJuror.user         (user.juror_assignments)

Show <──FK── ArtworkReview.show     (show.reviews)
Artwork <──FK── ArtworkReview.artwork (artwork.reviews)
User <──FK── ArtworkReview.juror    (user.artwork_reviews)
```

### Visibility

`Artwork.is_public` is the sole gate for public artwork visibility. Being assigned to a show does not make an artwork public — it must be set explicitly by a curator.

`gallery/permissions.py::visible_artwork_queryset(user)`:
- Staff/curators: see all artworks
- Authenticated users: see public artworks + their own
- Anonymous: see only `is_public=True`

---

## Schema.org Structured Data

Every public detail page includes a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block. Mappers in `eatart/schemaorg/mappers.py` convert model instances to Pydantic-validated Schema.org types:

| Page | Schema.org type |
|---|---|
| Artist detail | `Person` |
| Artwork detail | `VisualArtwork` |
| Show detail | `VisualArtsEvent` with `workFeatured` and `performer` |
| Event detail | `VisualArtsEvent` with `superEvent` pointing to the show |
| Homepage/about | `ArtGallery` |

The gallery's address, hours, and contact details are centralised in `eatart/schemaorg/profile.py`.

---

## Roles

| Group | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `artist` | Create and edit own artworks and artist profile |
| `curator` | Manage shows, events, and see all artworks |
| `juror` | Review assigned-show artworks with 1..5 ratings and notes |
| `staff` | Full access |

Superusers bypass all role checks. Group name constants are in `accounts/roles.py`.

---

## Database Migration (Legacy → Current)

The original database used `piece_*` tables. The migration to `gallery_*` is handled via SQL scripts in `docker/postgres/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `migrate-piece-to-gallery.sql` | Full transactional migration |
| `verify-piece-to-gallery.sql` | Row count and missing-record checks |

Run both in pgAdmin (or `psql`) after restoring the legacy dump and running Django migrations. See `database_migration_runbook.md` for the full workflow.

Key migration decisions:
- `gallery_show_artists` is derived from artwork membership — any artist with an artwork in a show becomes an artist of that show
- All imported artworks are set `is_public = true`
- Slugs have leading/trailing dashes stripped (matching Django's `build_unique_slug`)

---

## Deployment (Railway)

Production is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app). Railway injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically. Set all required env vars in the Railway project settings.

Static files and media are served from AWS S3 when `USE_S3=True`.
